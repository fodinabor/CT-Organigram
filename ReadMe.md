You always wanted to see your church.tools hierachy visually?
Just give it a try: https://ctorganigram.joameyer.de
I recommend using id / token login, as this works flawless - also with 2FA enabled - but email / password login is supported as well.

## Self hosting
Just install the files on a webserver supporting `php` and login.
You can customize the two variables `$group_leader_role_names` and `$group_members_role_names` to better fit your installation's role names.

is this deploying?
